The inspiration of this project comes from my love for cats (I have a cat named Allie!) and the uncontrollable stress I get when I don't have my to-do list all sorted out and organized. This project combines the two with arranging and having all the tasks in one place as well as a reward of cute cat pics once all the tasks are done!
